==============================

Robot Framework library for working with date/time strings in test suites

Description
-----------
This is a simple library created to allow Robotframework Test Suite writers to compare
two dates expressed in potentially different formats directly in a test step without 
having to do complicated string conversions in a user keyword.

Documentation for available keywords is in doc directory (generated by libdoc)

Issues
------
No doubt there are bugs and missing functionality in this library.  If you encounter any 
problems or have a feature request (i.e. new keywords you'd like to have), please open
an issue on the project's github issue tracker:
